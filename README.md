CryptoDonkeyMiners GPU Mining Switch will help you mine the most profitable cryptocurrency by calling your pre-defined batch files and switching over to the most profitable cryptocurrency.

The following cryptocurrencies are supported:
* BEAM

* ETHEREUMCLASSIC
* ETHEREUMPOW
* FIRO
* GEMLINK
* KASPA
* NEOXA
* RAVENCOIN

You need to set the following global settings:
* kWh cost in USD - The cost will determine profits or loss
* Check delay in minutes - How many minutes should pass before the next crypto mining profitability check

You need to set the following coin settings for each coin you want to mine:
* Hashrate - The hashrate, as seen on www.whattomine.com
* Watts - How many watts your mining consumes
* Batch path and file - The file path, like c:\miner\lolminer\mine_ergo.bat
* Enabled - If box is checked, will include in profitability check

Please use the save button to save your settings inbetween coin setups.

* MiniZ Miner
* BzMiner
* Team Black Miner
* WildRig Multi Miner

I stopped testing after that, as it should work with everything.
